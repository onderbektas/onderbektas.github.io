# About Me 
I graduated from the electronics engineering department in Istanbul Technical University in Turkey. In 2016, 
I received the Msc degree in communication engineering department at the same institute. During this time i worked as a research assistant. Later, I worked as an verification engineer in an electronic company  working for the Turkish defense industry. I am currently a data scientist at DenizBank in Istanbul.
  
My research areas was signal processing when i was a graduate student more specifically signal processing for inverse scattering problem and radar imaging.After that I would like to specialize for mathematical modeling, machine learning, statistical processing and optimization problem.
